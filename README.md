# UMD-Thesis-Template
An unofficial, updated template for a University of Maryland Ph.D. Thesis.
Based on the work of Dorothea F. Brosius at IREAP.
Origional documentation and files are located at https://ireap.umd.edu/resources/thesis-templates
This assumes you are using pdflatex and bibtex. 
More documentation is to come hopefully.
