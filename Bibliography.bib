It was found that dynamic methods (RUS and IE) have superior precision and repeatability when compared to NI and 4PB for all four tested materials. It was also found that the differences between results of RUS and IE are not statistically significant, and that NI can be equally successfully used for determining Young's modulus of well-prepared, microstructurally homogenous and relatively hard materials. 4PB was found to have the lowest precision and repeatability among the four test methods. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The anodes also provided good performance with propane and butane and, unlike Ni-GDC, there was little or no coking. The 4 wt {\%} Ni content in the anode was necessary to obtain good performance, indicating that a small amount of Ni provides a substantial electrocatalytic effect while not causing coking.

We review here the current status of solid oxide (SOFC) and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMFC) fuel cells. Such solid electrolyte systems obviate the need to contain corrosive liquids and are thus preferred by many developers over alkali, phosphoric acid or molten carbonate fuel cells. Dramatic improvements in power densities have been achieved in both SOFC and PEMFC systems through reduction of the electrolyte thickness and architectural control of the composite electrodes. Current efforts are aimed at reducing SOFC costs by lowering operating temperatures to 500-800 ??C, and reducing PEMFC system complexity be developing 'water-free' membranes which can also be operated at temperatures slightly above 100 ??C. ?? 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

The Butler–Volmer equation is used in the model to describe the activation overpotential instead of using simplified expressions such as the Tafel equation and the linear current–potential equation. In the concentration overpotential, both ordinary and Knudsen diffusions are considered to cater for different porous electrode designs. Sensitivity tests are then conducted to show the effect of the thickness of the respective fuel cell components on the drop in cell voltage. Results show that the performance of an anode-supported fuel cell is superior to that using cathode as the support under elevated operating pressure in the cathode compartment. The former can achieve an improved operating range of current density under normal atmospheric conditions.},

This temperature increase is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect due to measured increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Variations of volcanic aerosols and possibly solar luminosity appear to be primary causes of observed fluctuations about the mean trend of increasing temperature. It is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century, and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980's. Potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought-prone regions in North America and central Asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones, erosion of the West Antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.},

abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO(2) concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO(2) concentrations exceeding approximately 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

abstract = { Application of individual distributed generators can cause as many problems as it may solve. A better way to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a "microgrid". During disturbances, the generation and corresponding loads can separate from the distribution system to isolate the microgrid's load from the disturbance (providing UPS services) without harming the transmission grid's integrity. This ability to island generation and loads together has a potential to provide a higher local reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole. In this model it is also critical to be able to use the waste heat by placing the sources near the heat load. This implies that a unit can be placed at any point on the electrical system as required by the location of the heat load.},

Most fuel-cell research has involved the use of hydrogen as the fuel, although the practical generation and storage of hydrogen remains an important technological hurdle. Methane has been successfully oxidized electrochemically, but the susceptibility to carbon formation from other hydrocarbons that may be present or poor power densities have prevented the application of this simple fuel in practical applications. Here we report the direct, electrochemical oxidation of various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, 1-butene, n-butane and toluene) using a solid-oxide fuel cell at 973 and 1,073 K with a composite anode of copper and ceria (or samaria-doped ceria). We demonstrate that the final products of the oxidation are CO2 and water, and that reasonable power densities can be achieved. The observation that a solid-oxide fuel cell can be operated on dry hydrocarbons, including liquid fuels, without reforming, suggests that this type of fuel cell could provide an alternative to hydrogen-based fuel-cell technologies.},

abstract = {The rise of shale gas development through horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing has expanded oil and gas exploration in the USA. The rapid rate of shale gas exploration has triggered an intense public debate regarding the potential environmental and human health effects. A review of the updated literature has identified four potential risks for impacts on water resources: (1) stray gas contamination of shallow aquifers near shale gas sites; (2) contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater from spills, leaks, and disposal of inadequately treated wastewater or hydraulic fracturing fluids; (3) accumulation of toxic and radioactive residues in soil or stream sediments near disposal or spill sites; and (4) over-extraction of water resources for drilling and hydraulic fracturing that could induce water shortages and conflicts with other water users, particularly in water-scarce areas. As part of a long-term research on the potential water contamination associated with shale gas development, new geochemical and isotopic techniques have been developed for delineating the origin of gases and contaminants in water resource. In particular, multiple geochemical and isotopic (carbon isotopes in hydrocarbons, noble gas, strontium, boron, radium isotopes) tracers have been utilized to distinguish between naturally occurring dissolved gas and salts in water and contamination directly induced from shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations.},

abstract = {Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH(4) L(-1) (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L(-1) (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and $\delta$(2)H-CH(4) values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and-possibly-regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

Total world consumption of marketed energy expands from 549 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in 2012 to 629 quadrillion Btu in 2020 and to 815 quadrillion Btu in 2040—a 48{\%} increase from 2012 to 2040 (Table 1-1 and Figure 1-1). The IEO2016 Reference case assumes known technologies and technological and demographic trends, generally reflects the effects of current policies, and does not anticipate new policies that have not been announced (see box below). The IEO2016 Reference case projections do not include the effects of the recently finalized Clean Power Plan (CPP) regulations in the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) preliminary analysis of the proposed CPP 9 shows potential reductions of 21{\%} (about 4 quadrillion Btu) in U.S. coal consumption in 2020 and 24{\%} (almost 5 quadrillion Btu) in 2040 relative to the IEO2016 Reference case projection. With the CPP, U.S. renewable energy use in 2020 would be 7{\%} (about 1 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case, and in 2040 it would be 37{\%} (4 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case. U.S. consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels and of natural gas would be slightly lower with the CPP than in the Reference case.},

Model cells with a dense cathode interlayer demonstrated a compressive stress of 100sMPa at room temperature, and the results were compara- ble to those from X-ray diffraction. Model cells with a porous interlayer showed complex stress conditions that deviated from in-plane stress due to their porosity, and the model cell was confirmed not to be suitable for this method. At high temperatures, compressive stress was found to decrease as temperature increased and was almost neutral at the operating temperatures of the fuel cell, with good replication. Hence, the feasibility of this method for model cells with a dense cathode interlayer was confirmed.},

abstract = {Recent thermodynamic and electrical conductivity data are evaluated to select the most appropriate electrolyte composition for IT-SOFC operation at 500°C. Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has an ionic lattice conductivity of 10−2 Scm−1 at 500°C, and the Gd3+ ion is the preferred dopant, compared to Sm3+ and Y3+, at this temperature. Thermodynamic investigations indicate that for CeO2–Re2O3 solid solutions at intermediate temperatures it becomes easier to reduce Ce4+ as the concentration of Re2O3 is increased. As the associated electron mobilities do not appear to be a strong function of composition it follows that Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has a wider ionic domain than Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 at intermediate temperatures. Particular attention is drawn to the deleterious effects of impurities (principally SiO2) which are responsible for large dopant concentration dependent grain boundary resistivities. These grain boundary resistivities can obscure the intrinsic lattice ionic conductivities and cause investigators to select non-optimal dopant compositions. It follows that the use of clean (SiO2{\textless}50 ppm) powders is strongly recommended, particularly as these are now commercially available. At present there is also no compelling evidence to confirm that the intrinsic lattice electronic conductivity is significantly changed by co-doping with Pr6O11. Finally the I–V characteristics of single cells incorporating 25-$\mu$m thick Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolytes are modelled, and the requirements for composite electrodes briefly discussed so that power densities of 0.4 Wcm−2 at 500°C can be attained.},

However, under reducing conditions, the elastic moduli apparently decreased as p(O2) decreased even at a constant temperature, and such a decrease became more considerable under lower p(O2) conditions. The variation in the elastic moduli of GDC with p(O2) seemed to reflect the variation in the oxygen nonstoichiometry ??.

In addition, the volume change after redox cycling was examined by thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Samples with fine microstructure similar to a typical SOFC anode functional layer (AFL) and samples with coarse microstructure similar to a typical anode substrate were characterized. Coarse structured samples experienced no volume change or cracking upon redox cycling. Fine structured anode samples did not change in volume after reduction, but expanded between 0.9{\%} and 2.5{\%} after oxidation. The samples were significantly cracked after oxidation. The amount of expansion and cracking was reduced by lowering the Ni content of the anode and by reducing the oxidation temperature. The reduction of the NiO/YSZ samples followed linear kinetics with an activation energy of 78 kJ/mol. Ni/YSZ oxidation followed parabolic kinetics at temperatures lower than 700??C. A divergence from parabolic kinetics was seen at higher temperatures (700-850??C). This divergence has been seen in many other kinetic studies and is usually attributed to short-circuit diffusion mechanisms.

abstract = {The published literature relating to damage to SOFCs caused by redox cycling of Ni-based anodes is reviewed. The review covers the kinetics of Ni oxidation and NiO reduction (as single phases and as constituents of composites with yttria-stabilised zirconia, YSZ), the dimensional changes associated with redox cycling and the effect of this on the mechanical integrity and electrical performance of cells and stacks. A critical parameter is the expansion strain that is caused by oxidation. Several studies report that the first complete oxidation of a Ni/YSZ composite causes a linear expansion of the order of 1{\%}, but the actual values vary substantially between different investigations. The oxidation strain is the result of microstructural irreversibility during the redox process and leads to strain accumulation over several redox cycles. This can cause mechanical disruption to an anode, anode support or other cell components attached to the anode.A simplified mechanical model of the stress and damage that are likely to be caused by anode expansion is proposed and applied to anode-supported, electrolyte-supported and inert substrate-supported cell configurations. This allows the maximum oxidation strain to avoid damage in each configuration to be estimated.},

abstract = {To evaluate the reliability of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks during operation, the stress field in the stack must be known. During operation the stress field will depend on time as creep processes relax stresses. The creep of reduced Ni-YSZ anode support at operating conditions has been studied previously. In this work a newly discovered creep phenomenon taking place during the reduction is reported. This relaxes stresses at a much higher rate (?????104) than creep during operation. The phenomenon was studied both in three-point bending and uniaxial tension. Differences between the two measurements could be explained by newly observed stress promoted reduction. Finally, samples exposed to a small tensile stress (???0.004 MPa) were observed to expand during reduction, which is in contradiction to previous literature. These observations suggest that release of internal residual stresses between the NiO and the YSZ phases occurs during reduction. The accelerated creep should practically eliminate any residual stress in the anode support in an SOFC stack, as has previously been indirectly observed. This phenomenon has to be taken into account both in the production of stacks and in the simulation of the stress field in a stack based on anode supported SOFCs.},

The porosity of the as-sintered samples varied from 9 to 38{\%} and that of the reduced ones from 31 to 52{\%}. For all samples a linear relation between Young's modulus and porosity was found. The temperature dependency of the mechanical properties of both as-sintered and reduced composites was investigated by IET up to 1200 ??C. In the as-sintered state, first an increase and peak of stiffness coinciding with the N??el temperature, 250 ??C, of NiO was observed. Above this temperature, a linear decrease occurred. Specific damping showed a peak at 170-180 ??C and increased above ca. 1000 ??C in NiO-YSZ. In the reduced state the elastic modulus decreased linearly with temperature; specific damping increased above ca. 600 ??C and was found to be very dependent on microstructure. Damage caused by redox cycling degraded the elastic properties of the composites. Degradation started linearly from 0.5 to 0.6{\%} redox strain leading to macroscopic sample failures at about 2.5{\%} dL/Lo. A simple continuum elastic damage model was fitted to the degradation data. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In order for solid oxide fuel cells to survive the mechanical loading associated with residual manufacturing stresses, assembly, thermal mismatches, ion activity gradients, or operational loading, one or more components of the cell must provide sufficient mechanical strength. In anode-supported electrolyte designs, the anode layer is called upon to provide the necessary mechanical strength, in addition to fulfilling its electrical and electrochemical roles. To investigate how the starting powder sizes and how the reduction process parameters influenced the strength of NiO(Ni)-YSZ anode laminates, concentric ring-on-ring, biaxial flexure experiments were performed. Two composite microstructures and two reduction processes were examined. One specimen was obtained from powders with only fine (?????2????m) NiO and YSZ particles, while the other had a bi-modal distribution of coarse and fine particles of NiO (11????m and 5????m) and YSZ (4????m and 1????m). One reduction process introduces forming gas at room temperature, while the other process introduced forming gas only after the specimen reached its reduction temperature (600 or 800????C). The anodes containing coarse and fine particles had slower reduction rates, poorly connected microstructures, and had 35-40{\%} lower biaxial flexure strengths than anodes with only fine starting powders. The temperature at which forming gas was introduced had a significant impact on the microstructural evolution and thus also on the mechanical properties. Although introducing forming gas at room temperature led to more complete and faster reductions, the resulting microstructures were poorly connected, and the reduced laminates had almost 30{\%} less strength than laminates that were reduced at constant temperature. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The defect concentrations were conserved to room temperature by fast cooling. The results reveal that the elastic modulus of both pure ceria and GDC decreases drastically in samples heat treated at very low partial pressures of oxygen. However, the elastic modulus change for YSZ, within the studied range, is insignificant.

abstract = {The processing of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) often involves co-sintering of multi-layered stacks. In the case of SOFCs incorporating Ni-based anodes, hydrogen reduction of the anode usually takes place during the first service cycle of operation or conditioning. Initial reduction causes changes in the chemistry, microstructure and properties of the Ni-based anode material, which in turn induce mechanical stresses in the cell. In this study the elastic moduli, biaxial strength and fracture toughness of unreduced (NiO-YSZ) and reduced (Ni-YSZ) anode were determined as functions of porosity. Elastic properties were determined by impulse excitation at ambient temperature. Biaxial strength and fracture toughness were determined at ambient temperature by the ring-on-ring and double torsion test methods, respectively. It was found that the mechanical properties of unreduced and reduced Ni-based anode materials depend strongly on porosity. Property-porosity trends were found to be in good agreement with prediction of the minimum solid area model. Results presented in this study show that the elastic moduli and biaxial strength of the Ni-based anode material decreases after reduction in hydrogen while fracture toughness increases after reduction due to formation of ductile Ni-metal phase.

abstract = {A methodology is proposed in this study to investigate the creep properties of porous Ni-8YSZ cermet. Creep experiments have been conducted under reducing atmosphere at the typical SOFC operating temperatures. Specimens have been loaded in a four-point bending test bench. A special attention has been paid in this work to the analytical and numerical modelling of the mechanical test. It has been highlighted that Ni-8YSZ exhibits substantial creep strain rates even at relative low temperatures (700??C{\textless}T{\textless}850??C). The creep exponent has been found to be just slightly higher than unity (1{\textless}n{\textless}2) while the activation energy has been determined equal to Q=115kJmol-1.High-temperature plastic strains of both Ni and 8YSZ phases have been estimated through the local stress acting on the cermet particles. This analysis indicates that creep behaviour of the Ni-8YSZ composite is not influenced by the metallic phase, but is controlled by the deformation of the 8YSZ matrix. It is also proposed that cermet creep mechanism involves Zr4+cations diffusion at the surface rather than in the bulk of the 8YSZ material. Impact of the Ni-8YSZ cermet creep on the internal stresses distribution in SOFC is discussed considering the anode supported cell (ASC) design. It is shown that cermet creep strain can induce a substantial stress decrease in the thin electrolyte. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {For brittle failures, the probability distribution of structural strength and lifetime are known to be Weibullian, in which case the knowledge of the mean and standard deviation suffices to determine the loading or time corresponding to a tolerable failure probability such as 10(-6). Unfortunately, this is not so for quasibrittle structures, characterized by material inhomogeneities that are not negligible compared with the structure size (as is typical, e. g. for concrete, fibre composites, tough ceramics, rocks and sea ice). For such structures, the distribution of structural strength was shown to vary from almost Gaussian to Weibullian as a function of structure size (and also shape). Here we predict the size dependence of the distribution type for the lifetime of quasibrittle structures. To derive the lifetime statistics from the strength statistics, the subcritical crack growth law is requisite. This empirical law is shown to be justified by fracture mechanics of random crack jumps in the atomic lattice and the condition of equality of the energy dissipation rates calculated on the nano-scale and the macro-scale. The size effect on the lifetime is found to be much stronger than that on the structural strength. The theory is shown to match the experimentally observed systematic deviations of lifetime histograms from the Weibull distribution.},

The functionality of the cell is related to the structural integrity of the ceramic electrolyte, since its failure can lead to drastic performance losses. The mechanical property which is of most interest is the strength distribution at all relevant temperatures and how it is affected with time due to the environment. This study investigates the impact of the temperature on the strength and the fracture toughness of different zirconia electrolytes as well as the change of the elastic constants. 3YSZ and 6ScSZ materials are characterised regarding the influence of sub critical crack growth (SCCG) as one of the main lifetime limiting effects for ceramics at elevated temperatures. In addition, the reliability of different zirconia tapes is assessed with respect to temperature and SCCG. It was found that the strength is only influenced by temperature through the change in fracture toughness. SCCG has a large influence on the strength and the lifetime for intermediate temperature, while its impact becomes limited at temperatures higher than 650 °C. In this context the tetragonal 3YSZ and 6ScSZ behave quite different than the cubic 10Sc1CeSZ, so that at 850 °C it can be regarded as competitive compared to the tetragonal compounds.},

In this paper, we report the elastic behavior of three classical materials used in SOFCs as a function of temperature: Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and Ni-YSZ. Both YSZ and LSM present unusual behaviors. The elastic modulus of YSZ first decreases slowly up to 150 °C, then dramatically up to 550 °C (certainly due to atomic motion) and finally increases probably because of an order-disorder transition (oxygen vacancies). The state of the art on zirconia was reviewed. For the LSM material, Young's modulus could not be determined below 600 °C. Above this temperature, samples with totally closed porosity present a continuously increasing modulus, while the other samples have a quite constant modulus. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For free-standing cells oxidised in air, the main damage mode was electrolyte cracking after oxidation of approximately 50{\%} of the Ni in the substrate. However, cells oxidised electrochemically failed by substrate cracking after only ca. 5{\%} of the Ni was oxidised, mainly due to the non-uniform nature of oxidation in the SOFC. Models of the stress generation and fracture processes were developed for interpretation of the results. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Solid electrolytes are increasingly being used in active electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and batteries. Several fuel cells or batteries are connected in series to form a stack or a battery pack. The present manuscript examines the phenomenon of degradation in such devices, whose origin lies in the very basics of local thermodynamic equilibrium and transport. The specific example of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is addressed here. If a single cell (or a few cells) in a stack exhibits higher resistance than the rest of the cells, stack failure often initiates at such a cell. The cell is then driven by, and exhibits lower voltage than the rest of the cells, and often even a negative voltage. The objective of this paper is to present a model for stack degradation when one of the cells exhibits a negative voltage. The existence of low level electronic conduction through the electrolyte plays central role in degradation. It is shown that if a cell exhibits a negative voltage, the oxygen chemical potential within the electrolyte can exceed that in the oxidant, and/or can drop below that in the fuel. This can lead to high internal oxygen partial pressure resulting in electrode cracking and delamination, and/or very low oxygen partial pressure leading to local electrolyte decomposition. Both situations can lead to cell and stack degradation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Upon cyclic reduction and oxidation of Ni-YSZ ceramic-metal (cermet), the induced cell degradation constitutes one of the main limitations to the SOFCs lifetime. In this study, the effect of anode reduction and oxidation cycling on typical electrolyte supported cell (ESC) has been investigated. The electrochemical degradation has been followed by impedance spectroscopy. The cell damage has been characterised after testing with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It has been shown that cells can withstand several 'redox' cycles without major decrease in electrochemical performances. The 'redox' cycling induces only a slight degradation rate estimated to ???70 m?? cm2 per cycle. The microstructural observations are found to be consistent with the impedance diagram analysis. Both reveal that the damage is restricted to bulk cermet microstructure change, whereas no cracking is initiated at the anode/electrolyte interface. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In a first step several operated stacks were demounted for post-mortem inspection, followed by a fractographic evaluation of the failed cells. The respective findings are then set into a larger picture including an analysis of the present stresses acting on the cell like thermal and residual stresses and the measurements regarding the temperature dependent electrolyte strength. For all investigated stacks, the mechanical failure of individual cells can be attributed to locally acting bending loads, which rise due to an inhomogeneous and uneven contact between the metallic interconnect and the cell.?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The effects of Ni-YSZ cermet re-oxidation in anode supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have been investigated. Damage mechanisms have been studied in both cases of direct oxidation in air (i.e., fuel shutdown) or by an ionic current (i.e., fuel starvation). Direct oxidation tests show that the electrolyte cracks for a conversion degree of Ni into NiO ranging between ???58 and ???71{\%}. This failure mode has been modelled considering both the bulk expansion of the cermet induced by the transformation of the Ni phase and the change of mechanical stresses in the multilayered cell. In the case of fuel starvation, a thin layer of the cermet was electrochemically re-oxidised at 800 ??C and then reduced under a hydrogen stream. This 'redox' cycle was repeated until the degradation of the cell. The evolution of the impedance diagrams recorded after each cycle suggests that the cermet damages in an area close to anode/electrolyte interface. The mechanical modelling states that a delamination can occur along the interface between the Anode Functional Layer (AFL) and the Anode Current Collector (ACC) substrate. This theoretical result confirms the experimental trends observed by impedance spectroscopy. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is well known that many electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries, etc. degrade under various operating conditions. Many devices are based on solid electrolytes. In many cases, degradation manifests as electrode delamination and/or cracking of the electrolyte. An apparently obvious conclusion often reached is that this must be due to weak interfaces and some approach to mechanical strengthening or toughening should alleviate the problem. It is the intent of this manuscript to show that such electrochemical degradation often occurs due to electrochemical-mechanical coupling effects which result in extremely large internal pressures. So large can be the pressures that no amount conventional strengthening or toughening can prevent degradation. In fact, even a perfect lattice can be disrupted by electrochemically induced pressure leading to failures. In order to prevent failures, it is necessary to fully understand the role of coupling and develop strategies of mitigating high pressure formation by optimizing ion and electron transporting properties of the membrane. This manuscript discusses a fundamental mechanism of electrochemical failure of solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide electrolyzer cells, and oxygen separators based on oxygen ion conducting solid electrolytes. Experimental results on two types solid electrolyte cells are presented in support of the mechanism. {\textcopyright}},

The mechanical failure of the electrolyte would cause leakage between the electrodes, leading to a reduction of the performance of a whole fuel cell stack. In order to assess the reliability of a certain zirconia tape with respect to a specific stress distribution and environment, the strength has to be properly characterised. In the present study a selection of several commercial highly ionic conductive scandia doped zirconia tapes was investigated regarding their strength under inert and humid conditions at room temperature, which required the determination of the elastic constants and the fracture toughness as well. The strength of the different zirconia tapes ranks according to their fracture toughness, while the strength distributions typically exhibit a Weibull modulus of m = 10. It was found that all tapes suffer from sub critical crack growth, which leads to a limited lifetime at a given static load and a drastic reduction of the room temperature strength at time scales relevant for actual operation.},

abstract = {The stress state and cell degradation have been modelled considering the classical solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) materials (Ni-YSZ//YSZ//LSM). The anode-supported cell is found to be un-cracked after its elaboration. However, the high level of energy stored in the thin electrolyte layer lowers the cell robustness as it constitutes the driving force for interfacial delamination. The elaboration of the electrolyte supported cell leads to the anode layer cracking. The heating up to 800 ??C and the cermet reduction allow relaxing the stress level in the cell. For the anode-supported cell, the cermet re-oxidation induces cathode damage as soon as the anodic strain exceeds 0.05-0.09{\%} whereas the electrolyte fracture occurs for strain ranging between 0.12{\%} and 0.15{\%}. For the electrolyte supported cell, the cermet re-oxidation induces a triggered risk of anode/electrolyte delamination when the anodic strain is higher than 0.3-0.35{\%}. The risk of rupture initiation in cell singularities has been also investigated. A pure material electrode/electrolyte singularity is harmless. A perpendicular corner at the electrode/electrolyte free edge constitutes a harmful singularity. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The YSZ was supplied by two manufacturers as 150 $\mu$m thick sheet suitable for the electrolyte in a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The two materials had the cubic structure and this crystal structure was maintained up to 1100°C, which was the highest temperature investigated. However, there were differences, albeit small in most cases, in composition, density, grain size and surface finish between the products from the two manufacturers. Although the compositional and structural variations resulted in some differences in mechanical performance, the general trends shown by both materials were similar. The strength, as determined by biaxial flexure, fell by 23–30{\%} on increasing the test temperature from room temperature (RT) to the SOFC operating temperature of 950°C and there was evidence for changes in crack initiation and propagation mechanisms at the higher temperature. The loading rate dependence of the RT strength yielded a low value for the stress exponent n in the standard lifetime equation, which indicated that sub-critical crack growth (sccg) was sensitive to applied stress. Constant load tests at 950–1000°C illustrated the sensitivity of sccg to stress and revealed that creep was also operative in this temperature range. It was concluded that the creep probably occurred by a grain boundary diffusion mechanism.},

abstract = {The Weibull distribution is widely used to describe the scatter of the strength in brittle (but also quasi-brittle) materials, often assuming that the Weibull modulus is a "material constant". One possible motivation of this perhaps comes from the classical Freudenthal's interpretation of Weibull modulus depending on the crack size distribution, which however assumes the cracks to be at large distance one from the other. It is here found with simple numerical experiments with collinear cracks that Weibull distributions tend to be obtained also with interaction taken into account, but the Weibull modulus depends on both the crack size distribution and the distribution of ligaments. Hence, Weibull modulus should not be considered a "material constant" or to correspond to an "intrinsic" microstructure of the material, as assumed in many industrial applications and commercial postprocessors of FEM softwares, even in the case of a varying stress fields. In the limit case of a crack or sharp notch this leads to paradoxically a zero scale parameter (and the usual Weibull modulus). Hence, in the case of a blunt notch, we suggest the Weibull modulus would vary depending on the distribution of cracks, their distances, and the interaction with the geometry and stress field. Only numerical simulations where the distribution of cracks is directly included in the geometry under consideration can provide the correct scale factor and Weibull modulus. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Understanding the electronic charge distribution around oxygen vacancies in transition metal and rare earth oxides is a scientific challenge of considerable technological importance. We show how significant information about the charge distribution around vacancies in cerium oxide can be gained from a study of high resolution crystal structures of higher order oxides which exhibit ordering of oxygen vacancies. Specifically, we consider the implications of a bond valence sum analysis of Ce 7 O 12 and Ce 11 O 20 . To illuminate our analysis we show alternative representations of the crystal structures in terms of orderly arrays of coordination defects and in terms of fluorite-type modules. We found that in Ce 7 O 12 , the excess charge resulting from removal of an oxygen atom delocalizes among all three triclinic Ce sites closest to the O vacancy. In Ce 11 O 20 , the charge localizes on the next nearest neighbour Ce atoms. Our main result is that the charge prefers to distribute itself so that it is farthest away from the O vacancies. This contradicts the standard picture of charge localization which assumes that each of the two excess electrons localizes on one of the cerium ions nearest to the vacancy. This standard picture is assumed in most calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Based on the known crystal structure of Pr 6 O 11 , we also predict that the charge in Ce 6 O 11 will be found in the second coordination shell of the O vacancy. We also extend the analysis to the Magn{\'{e}}li phases of titanium and vanadium oxides (M n O 2 n − 1 , where M = Ti, V) and consider the problem of metal–insulator transitions (MIT) in these oxides. We found that the bond valence analysis may provide a useful predictive tool in structures where the MIT is accompanied by significant changes in the metal–oxygen bond lengths. Although this review focuses mainly on bulk cerium oxides with some extension to the Magn{\'{e}}li phases of titanium and vanadium, our approach to characterizing electronic properties of oxygen vacancies and the physical insights gained should also be relevant to surface defects and to other rare earth and transition metal oxides.},

abstract = {Fuel cells are uniquely capable of overcoming combustion efficiency limitations (e.g., the Carnot cycle). However, the linking of fuel cells (an energy conversion device) and hydrogen (an energy carrier) has emphasized investment in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells as part of a larger hydrogen economy and thus relegated fuel cells to a future technology. In contrast, solid oxide fuel cells are capable of operating on conventional fuels (as well as hydrogen) today. The main issue for solid oxide fuel cells is high operating temperature (about 800 degrees C) and the resulting materials and cost limitations and operating complexities (e.g., thermal cycling). Recent solid oxide fuel cells results have demonstrated extremely high power densities of about 2 watts per square centimeter at 650 degrees C along with flexible fueling, thus enabling higher efficiency within the current fuel infrastructure. Newly developed, high-conductivity electrolytes and nanostructured electrode designs provide a path for further performance improvement at much lower temperatures, down to {\~{}}350 degrees C, thus providing opportunity to transform the way we convert and store energy.},
